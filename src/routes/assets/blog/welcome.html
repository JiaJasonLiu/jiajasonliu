<h1>My first ever blog</h1>
<p>I am already too lazy to write this as I could just use AI to do.
But I will try to make a commitment to myself to not use copilot or any other AI tools while writing this because the grayed out words make it so annoying to think for myself as they are just major distractions.</p>

<h2>
    So what will I be sharing
</h2>
<p>
    Nothing much really, my plan for this blog is for me to improve my writing and start documenting my personal and tech experience onto my personal website.
    There really isn'y much to say, but please and try to enjoy my journey as I try and find a job, gain experience, make connections, learn and one day make a successful startup of my own one day.
</p>

<p>
    I wish you and I good luck on our respective paths that we have chosen for ourselves.

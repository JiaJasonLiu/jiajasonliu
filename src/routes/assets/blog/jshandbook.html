<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>
    Hello there, my name is Jason, and I would like to share some insights that I have learned at my time working. 
    I start here because this was the first time where I have actually made an impact on people's lives rather than solving leetcode and math problems.
    Furthermore, I believe that a manual is boring and pointless for nuances that are situational like programming.
    Therefore, I will focus on storytelling rather than just listing facts, and so I believe that I will have self-contained stories also referenced in this Handbook.
    To preface, my motto as a software engineer is that this job is not suppose to be about just writing code, but being able to analyze a problem and pinpoint the necessary steps to fix it.
    I don't see it as any different than solving a math problem, but for me, programming is a much more beautiful and elegant way of solving problems.

    My First Step

    about me talking about how I interned at a place and chose to do my placement there.
    That place is called Sparklayer B2B.
    I say this because it was the place where everyone made me extremely curious about computer science, starting a company, what it takes to be a salesman or on the marketing team.
    It is because of these amazing people that I started to create this handbook that you are reading right now.

<h1>
    The Practical
</h1>
<p>
    The following are the categories I would say some of my colleagues belonged to
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Gut feeling</li>
    <li>Documentation </li>
    <li>Expert Googling </li>
    <li>Use of AI (for optimization) </li>
</ul>
<p class="-mt-3"> 
    There is nothing wrong with any of these approaches because you can be in multiple. 
    I think the key is being self-aware of the one you are using and if it is truly the most suitable one.

<h2>
    Quotes
</h2>
These were quotes that really stuck to me during my Job
<ul>
    <li> "Be in a room where you can learn from everyone around you" </li> 
    <li> "Join a job where the employees give a shit" </li>
    <li> "Recruit people that are smarter than you"</li>
    <li> "Leave things better than they were" </li>
    <li> "Think about what your searching, the best keywords and phrasing, sometimes it takes a few searches to find" </li>
    <li> Always find a way to simplify stuff </li>
    <li> Read the documentation when you don't understand anything </li>
    <li> When finishing a work, AI it and learn from that< </li>
    <li> "I just know" its experience and very good speculations </li>
    <li> Make diagrams (flow charts) of features, helpful for understanding and refactoring </li>
</ul>
<h2>
    Tips
</h2>

<ul>
<li>
    Instead of Manual Labor, someone else has probably come up with the method you already thought of.
    So, save some time

<h2>
    Mindset for Solving a Problem 
</h2>
    <p>Start solving a problem by forming his own assumptions about it. He first checks if those assumptions are correct. If they are not, he works to identify the actual issue.</p>

    <p>Once he understands the problem, he formulates different possible solutions. He then evaluates each solution by considering not just whether it <em>can</em> be implemented, but whether it <em>should</em> be. This helps ensure the solution aligns with the overall integrity and maintainability of the codebase.</p>

    <p>After choosing the best approach, he implements the solution and thoroughly tests it.</p>

    <p>When reviewing the code after finishing, look for opportunities to delete unnecessary parts, aiming to eliminate redundancies. He tries to condense the code so it works with minimal components and considers whether future developers would be able to understand it easily.</p>

    <h3>Defensive Thinking and System Stability (Context: using Redis)</h3>

    <p>Always considers worst-case scenarios, such as the Redis Runner hitting the server under unexpected conditions. It's important to have a catch method to handle situations like the Redis server going down or there being no messages to process.</p>

    <p>Instead of rerunning Goroutines repeatedly, ensure there are conditions in place to stop them when theyâ€™re no longer needed, avoiding unnecessary system burden.</p>

    <p><strong>Insight:</strong> Focusing solely on performance can sometimes backfire. It's essential to also think about broader conditions and impacts when building robust systems.</p>

    All in All

    This is the gist of what I have learned, as this is continuously updated, I would definitely like to hear some feedback and if you think I was wrong in anyway.
    I am always down for a quick chat!
